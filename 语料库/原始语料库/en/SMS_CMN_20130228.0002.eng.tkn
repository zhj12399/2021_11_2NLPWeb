Have you slept ? 
I can look after your son for you 
I have n’t slept yet 
I pick my daughter up at five o’clock everyday 
Have you asked ? 
Do n’t ’ make me late 
Did you leave your house at five o’clock ? 
Yes 
That road always has traffic jams 
Okay . I will ask my husband to go on time in due course 
Okay 
I will tell you when I need your help the week after the 19th . Thank you ! 
You still can not be back at five o’clock ? 
It is not the 19th . It is the 10th
