Hello He Ting , may I know if your house is still for rent ? 
Yes , what 's up ? 
Hello , are you still there ? 
I have booked the flight ticked for Philadelphia on July 9th . I would like to rent your house for June , is it OK ? 
I 'll rent the master room for one month first , if it turns out fine , we can renew the lease together , otherwise I can move out in August , is this OK to you ? 
I 'll be offline , let 's keep in touch . We can continue to talk tonight ( US time ) 
He Ting , are you there ? [ emoticon ] 
He Ting , if your house has n't been rented out , can you rent it to me between July 9th and August 9th ? I will arrive at Philadelphia airport on the morning of July 9th . [ emoticon ]
