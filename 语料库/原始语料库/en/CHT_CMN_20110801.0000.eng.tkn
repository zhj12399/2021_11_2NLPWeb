Is Engineer Dong there ? The platform can already be used , but right now it is still not possible to ping different ports 
The policy has already been opened , I 'll look at the policy again when I am able to get online in a minute 
Uh , =OK 
Are you there , Engineer Dong ? It 's still not possible to have mutual access 
I 'm here , 
What is the address of your internal network ? 
The policy has been opened , 
It is on target , 
why wo n't the test go through ? 
If I PING under port 2 , it will go through 
Does this machine allow PING ? 
It does n't work under 3 
It is a big screen , and can directly ping 
Try again , 
I can not PING through from the device 
Alright 
It still does n't work 
I also can not PING through from the device 
Where we are , from the second floor computer room 's port number 2 , we can PING through â€¦ 
Can you PING through on the same switch ? 
It does not seem to have reached the firewall 
Can the big screen PING through the gateway ? 
The big screen is just a card 
It is under the same switch 
This over here comes out of the device , and is directly connected by fiber optic cable 
Over there , it comes =out of port number 2 , and is separated after being connected with a switch 
Is it possible to PING through each other between different PC machines , across switches ? 
It seems like it can go through 
This is the health division 's machine , it belongs to port number 2 
I 'll look =again at the big screen 
There 's no problem with the policy , 
it seems like it 's over there with the big screen 
Uh-huh , =OK , Engineer Dong , I 'll check again 
Hmm , if there 's a problem , I will consult you =again , and first I 'll go look at the equipment 
Engineer Zhang , is the big screen 's issue resolved ? 
Have you found the cause ? 
Maybe the electrical switch inside has been tripped , we 're looking for the repair person right now , and see =how it can be resolved 
Engineer Dong , it still does n't work 
Right now , it 's still that way , you can ping through in the computer room , but in the west wing of the hospital it does n't work 
Can you PING through the gateway ? 
Yes 
Including the big screen ? 
Computers on the same switch as the big screen can PING through to the big screen and can PING through to other switches ' computers as well , right ? 
Yes , they can 
Is the big screen a computer ? 
No , it 's not a machine , just a thing similar to an Internet card 
It can match an IP address , but it does n't have a MAC address 
Have you connected a notebook computer to the screen 's Internet cable and set up an IP address to substitute for the big screen ? 
Could you see if computers on other switches can access it ? 
Use a notebook computer to substitute for the big screen 
Later , I 'll go have a try 
Just replace it with the notebook computer and that will be enough 
It does n't matter if you replace the big screen or not , they 're all under the same switch 
It is necessary to test it , and see if it is a policy problem , can other computers access each other through the different ports of different switches and firewalls ? 
There 's just one switch in the computer room 
The remainder is directly connected by fiber optic cable to the third floor of the hospital 's western wing 
So , can PCs going through the ports of different firewalls access each other ? 
In the past , they could n't access 
After you 've added the policy , you can use them 
In the morning , I ping'ed a machine under port 2 from under port 3 
and could ping through 
Then maybe it 's the big screen 's issue , 
My thought is to switch the big screen with a computer , test it , and confirm where the problem is coming from 
Right now , the policy for the firewall 's connection to the internal network is completely open 
There are no restrictions =between the internal network 's connections , 
and the ARP table =also does n't have any 
also does n't have any 
If it does not work to achieve this , look for the agent to resolve the problem on the spot
