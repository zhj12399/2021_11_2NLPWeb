Hello , teacher . I 'm your candlelight guide student . I have some questions I 'd like to ask you .
Speak 
I have a school friend at (( SCNU )). He is thinking about applying to be a postgrad in translation at Wuhan University . He wants to know the relevant information 
For example the scores needed to be accepted , how many people are accepted each year ... 
Oh , I 'm in the English department , and I 'm not too sure about the situation in Translation 
Oh , OK . Thank you , teacher .
Sorry 
Never mind , never mind . Sorry to disturb you , teacher .
