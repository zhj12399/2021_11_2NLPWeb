Are you back ? 
Not yet 
I 'm going back tomorrow .
I 'll arrive the day after tomorrow in the morning ~~ 
I see … I wanted to ask you whether that electric hair dryer of yours had arrived or not 
It had still not arrived when I left … 
I do n't know if it has now arrived or not 
When I get back , I 'll take a look ...
