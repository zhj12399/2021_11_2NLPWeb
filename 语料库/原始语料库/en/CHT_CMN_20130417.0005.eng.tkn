Are you busy ? 
Say 
Will anybody take charge of me if I set a street booth on Gutian 3rd Road ? 
There are people taking charge , it â€™ll be ok if you pay some money 
It seems some yuan each day 
Pay to whom ? 
Whoever that charges you ... I am not clear either 
You got to strive to get a location ... Hehe

Many people 
Very many people in the evening 
We had a visit on the Sunday evening

When does it normally begin ? 
It will begin right after super 
Around 6 , I think
