How 's this week been ? Do you have time to join our Friday night party ? 
No time . I 'm testing comps for 12 classes next week . Been preparing like crazy for tests this month , and still have to look for work . Boo hoo , boo hoo . Work is so hard 
So many things . Hope you can still get rest and wisdom from God 
Hope so , hope so . Praying everyday , but still no big gain . I think this major is too difficult to deal with 
Do what you can . Let God be in charge of the rest
