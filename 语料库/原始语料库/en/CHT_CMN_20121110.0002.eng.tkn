Ce Ce~~ How are you doing today ? 
It 's boring here . How about you ? 
Just OK~~ Perhaps a bit more interesting~~ I go to and from work every day~ And I dine out with Hao Zhi , Lei Tian and Jia Shuo when we are free~~ 
Have you adapted yourself there ? Are you far from Wei Gonggong ? 
Very far . I have not adapted very well 
Language is a big problem 
Then you can teach them Chinese~ and promote the Chinese culture~~ Haha 
It is like one of the East and one of the West~ 
Take your time~~ A few months later~ you will even feel uncomfortable if you do n't listen to English and do n't speak English~
