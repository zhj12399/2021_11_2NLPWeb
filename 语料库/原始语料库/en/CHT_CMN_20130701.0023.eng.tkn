It ca n't be helped , we are just small potatoes 
Doing whatever we are told 
I 'll talk to Director Zhou 
Do n't 
The leader might think I am complaining 
Rest assured 
Do more if you can , it 's not tiring 
Do n't make the leader think that we have complaints 
Well , OK .
This is for your good 
I just feel injustice for us laborers 
Alas , =forget it 
Forget it 
I am content to have such a gallant friend like you
