Hehe , my boss wants you to take a couple of photographs of the Korean restaurants . Just pick two big or famous ones . Do it with 3 or 4 different angles for each one , you do not have to go inside , only the facade . Do you think it is convenient for you ? 
Let me try . I do n't even know where the Korean restaurants are here 
He said he can provide you with the addresses 
But I think it will be more convenient if you pick on your own 
You decide , if you need addresses , I will send them to you 
If there are addresses , send them to me for reference 
I will e - mail you later . Thanks [ emoticon ] 
I rarely eat out , so I do n't really know
