You there ? 
I arrive in New York on the 14th , and return to Hong Kong on the 18th 
What day of the week is the 14th in New York ? 
If there 's still accomodation , where is the best place ? 
The 14th is Thursday 
Accomodation is based on where you mostly plan on doing in New York 
Sightseeing or shopping ? 
I think the most convenient is to stay in Manhattan or Flushing
