For the first half year ? 
Mine is not even sorted out 
Does this still need to be separated ? 
Gosh 
I 'll search when I am back home 
I feel there are very few , I use the oil card every time 
Last time , the meal card was exchanged for 2,000 yuan 
There were no receipts 
I got them from my aunt 
You are not in a hurry , right ? 
I 'll get my aunt to sort out hers , each year I always get them from her 
No hurry
