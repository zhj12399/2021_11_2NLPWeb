Dad , someone hacked a friend 's QQ and tried to get me to talk on QQ just now . I knew he was a liar , but he knows my name and also some things about my family . Seems a lot like my classmate 's manner of speaking 
So , these days if someone on QQ uses my tone to ask for money , do n't give them money under any circumstances 
My living expenses are certainly not lacking . I absolutely wo n't spontaneously ask for money , and I wo n't be borrowing money from my classmates . Bear that in mind 
Just asked other friends . Someone 's home has already reported to the police that they had been cheated of money . Be very careful 
I know . It has happened once already , and it was discovered .
You know too , pretending to be you .
Yeah . This time it 's pretty serious . He 's cheating by pretending to be another person . He used my friend 's QQ to trick me and find out my family status to later hack my QQ and trick my family . My classmate 's family that got cheated was fooled like this
