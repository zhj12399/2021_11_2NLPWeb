Do you know how to post a =microblog for a group , but one that does n't show up in the other person 's " Sent to me " notifications ? 
This problem is very technical ... I do n't know ... I 've never tried it 
OK . But I 've seen your microblog posted for a group without being notified , and I actually thought you 'd set it up 
Er , I have n't posted a microblog for a group ... 
There is a picture of it , it must be the truth ~~ 
Eh ? How come I do n't know how to do this ... 
[ emoticon ] OK ~~ 
Really â€¦ I actually do n't know ! 
How should this thing be posted ? 
I do n't know how it turned out like that either ... Haha 
When you are posting a =microblog , just modify a bit with regard to publication

Never mind . I 'll find one 
In any case , officially , major comes first , right ?
