Are you there ? 
Yes 
We indeed have not put the income on that form 
No figure can be filled in 
If we fabricate a figure , they may require a tax payment proof or something like that . We ca n't fabricate that 
Then do we have students under the name of Chongqing Haitian Qiaochu Software Vocational Training School ? There must be income if we have students 
It is also a required number 
Are we allowed not to report the number ? 
Because the human resources and Social Security Bureau know us too well . They know the number of our enrolled students in the first year of enrollment and it is impossible that the number of students is now zero
