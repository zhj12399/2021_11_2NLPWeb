Your father has quit smoking ! That 's so great !! 
Hee hee . When one gets older , his goal is to live longer , ha ha 
How is everything going recently ? I am going to take the final exam in early May . I picked two courses , but one of them , econometrics , is very hard .
I have not studied economics courses before , and I do n't know any friend who studies economics . I am so nervous : - )
