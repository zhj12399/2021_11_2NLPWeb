Did your classmate in Hangzhou receive it yet ? 
He did 
It was very slow this time 
It took four weeks .
Yes 
There are still three that have =no news 
It ’s been over a month 
... 
They were sent from Boston and NY 
Anyway , if they are not lost , they will arrive eventually 
At any rate , I sent them 
As for whether they arrive or not , it ’s out of my control , hehe 
You are heartless
