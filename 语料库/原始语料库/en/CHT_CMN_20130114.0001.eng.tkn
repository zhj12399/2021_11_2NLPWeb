Pretty good , but can we still go back to the old classroom ? 
We can ask the monitor for this , but not all people are available .
In the 1960s and 1970s , people generally still believed that Monk Fahai put Xu Xian in captivity to capture the monsters .
In 1980s and 1990s , people generally believed that Fahai made things difficult for Xu Xian because he himself loved the white snake ; 
However , when the 21st century arrives , almost all the people think that Fahai was fiercely fierce fighting Bai Suzhen because he wanted to get Xu Xian himself .
Anybody here ? 
I am coming .
Take care .
