I 'm here 
Un-huh 
I 'm sorry - I was on the phone just now 
Why did you eat dumplings ? 
It was the winter solstice yesterday 
Oh , you are southerners 
Oh , thanks . I did n't 
Have you eaten ? 
I 've eaten . Heh heh , it 's a Northern custom 
My mother is back and strict with me . I 'm going to bed 
Okay . Heh heh . Good night
