hi , dear , I forgot to bring my cellphone to work today , I just got home . If it is convenient for you tomorrow , can you give me a call after getting up in the morning ? What time do you usually leave ? I 'll wait for you at the kroger entrance 
OK , then I 'll wait for you at the Chase ATM near your home at about five past nine . I happen to have to deposit a check there anyway . Is it convenient for you to walk through the =shrubs ? 
OK , no problem , I 'll wait for you there at 9 , thanks !!! 
You 're welcome , rest early , see you tomorrow morning 
OK , good night : ) 
Have you left home ? 
Arriving in a second
