Is it best to go to Philadelphia by train or by bus ? If by bus , from which station ? 
There is JFK & BROAD , PA =PHILADELPHIA 10 TH ST , PA 
Also , if you do n't know =PHILADELPHIA PA , Tell me which place you are staying at nearby and I will come over 
It is most convenient by train from DC to Philadelphia . The time is short and trip frequency high .
To check the trip go to : http://www.amtrak.com/home The train station is the union station in DC .
It is the 30th street station to go to Philadelphia , quite close to my workplace .
I will wait for your call in the office . When you are about to arrive I will go to the train station to meet you .
There is also free wifi on the train . So you can contact me any time
