Hey Nathan , it was very chaotic a few days ago registering , moving things , selecting classes , and what not . I 'm sorry that I only get in touch with you now ! 
Is there any designated authors for 3 . ? Or is it okay if they are contemporary ? 
I 'll go to class first . I 'll contact you later~ 
I 'm sorry . I just came back . I still have n't confirmed on the designated authors yet . I 'm still looking .
If convenient , you can find works of some more mainstream and prolific British writers .
Let me investigate first . I 'm reading McEwan 's Atonement . Could you investigate and recommend the rest ? 
I switched to engage in English Literature halfway . I was originally engaged in Linguistics .
I started studying for PhD this year and specialize in English Literature . I 'm truly grateful for your help .
I hope that it wo n't affect your studies . It would be best if the electronic version has PDF format . I hope that it is a version that I can copy . Do whatever is convenient to you .
