Hello Lin Meng , I placed an order online for a desk from you , but then did n't find you on QQ . I just arrived at UV . The internet would n't connect . Is your desk still there ? 
Yes , but I moved earlier than expected . The desk is at a friend 's new home now . It takes half an hour to drive there which is quite far . I guess there 's no way to move it â€¦ 
Oh , Okay , then forget it
