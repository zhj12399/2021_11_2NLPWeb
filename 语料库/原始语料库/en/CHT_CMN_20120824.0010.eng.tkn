Sister , have you arrived in the US ? 
Uh-huh 
Umm , is everything going well ? 
Quite well 
I 've just settled down 
Can you adjust to the time difference ? 
It 's OK 
This is my new computer , and I need to get used to it 
[ emoticon ] What do you mean ? 
I 'm installing software 
Hmm , if you 've settled down , then that 's good 
Hmm 
I 'm going to =sleep now 
to sleep 
to adjust to the time difference ... 
Hmm , OK .
Good night ~
