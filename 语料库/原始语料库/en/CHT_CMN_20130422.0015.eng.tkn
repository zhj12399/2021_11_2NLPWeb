Hello , may I ask if any of these posts that require payment of settlement fees before employment does not have an age limit ? 
No. 
Our company 's trainees or adult test candidates 33 years old or younger will be fine .
All of them have age requirements . Is it unacceptable even if the age exceeds just one or two years ? 
Can I apply for the highway job ? 
I am nearly 29 years old
