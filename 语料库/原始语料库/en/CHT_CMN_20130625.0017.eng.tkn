Have you changed your computer ? 
Are you talking about the laptop ? 
Yes 
No , I hardly use it now 
I use ipad to surf the internet at home 
Mine also begins to run slowly , it 's better to change it with another one if I want to take it out 
HP is really bad 
Right , you definitely need to buy a portable one if you go abroad 
I do n't know when did this one break down 
Well , buy a new one
