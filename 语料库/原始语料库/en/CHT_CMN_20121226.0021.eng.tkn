The chosen topic is very good , but the subject should be clarified .
Do you want to discuss the current situation and reason of English study among Chinese people , or the history of English study among Chinese people , or restriction of English study among Chinese people by the study of other foreign languages ? 
It 's enough to discuss one aspect . Do n't involve too expensive aspects . It 's just my personal opinion for reference .

Thank you , teacher ><~ [ picture ]
