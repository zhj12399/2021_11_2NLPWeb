Are you going home tomorrow already ? 
Yes , I ’m going home tomorrow . I ’m organizing the last orders today .. 
When do you begin working after the Chinese New Year ? 
I start working on the 8th day of the Lunar New Year 
How does it look over there ? 
It ’s all right . I ’ve been quite busy lately 
At any rate , the Chinatown is a little more lively during the Spring Festival here . We still go to work as usual 
Father ’s asthma has gotten a little better lately . The oxygen machine has some effects 
Oxygen therapy is the most basic . I hope that he can stick to it . There is no good medication either
