Are you here ? 
Yes 
We will think about this when it grows up 
Hehe , the growth will be delayed if we do n't go to your place ... 
Hehe , is n't it so exaggerated ? 
Will you bring your kid here on Saturday ? 
You are delaying the growth of your kid 
Of course 
Every kid needs to come to My Gym once whenever there is a chance 
This is like building a house , the base needs to be built from childhood
