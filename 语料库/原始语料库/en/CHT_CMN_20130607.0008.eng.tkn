Hi , Engineer Zhang , are you there ? 
I 'm unable to scan the infusion barcode now 
I 'm unable to scan with the PDA of both the newly modified system and old system , it showed invalid barcode 
So where should it be put ? 
Try by clicking elsewhere at the bottom 
I tried , but it just showed invalid 
Connect the PDA to Zhang Youshuai 's machine using a data cable , then give me remote access , , scan the barcode for me
